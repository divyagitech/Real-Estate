# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using machine learning model. The goal is to create accurate predictive model that can estimate real estate prices based on various features.
# Files and Directory Structure
Different models output.txt: A text file containing the accuracy of different machine learning models.

data.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the predictive model.

prediction_model.joblib: Machine learning model saved using joblib, ready for making predictions.

real_estate.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
